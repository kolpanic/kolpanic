I'm a Toronto-based developer spending most of my time in Xcode. I used to work at [Flixel](https://flixel.com/kolpanic), where our app Cinemagraph Pro for macOS won a [2014 Apple Design Award](https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/103xx8s53gk94hl/103/103_hd_apple_design_awards.mov#t=2260,4111).

I'm also a co-founder—and co-runner for its first ten years—of [tacow / Toronto CocoaHeads](https://www.meetup.com/tacow-org/).

I have a number open-source projects available [here on Github](https://github.com/kolpanic), including [ZipKit](https://github.com/kolpanic/ZipKit), an Objective–C framework for using PKZip archives on macOS and iOS.
